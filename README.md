# 🏓 Ping Pong Game (C++ with Raylib)

A simple **Ping Pong game** built in C++ using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.  
It was created as a mini-project to explore **game development** and **basic AI** using **OOP principles**.

---

## 🎮 Features
- Two players:
  - **Human player** → controlled via keyboard.
  - **CPU (AI)** → paddle automatically tracks the ball’s position.
- Classic Ping Pong mechanics (ball bounce, scoring, paddle movement).
- Clean **Object-Oriented Programming** structure.
- Beginner-friendly introduction to AI-based paddle detection.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **C++**
- **Raylib** (lightweight graphics/game library)

---

## 📥 Installation & Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pong-game.git
   cd ping-pong-game
Make sure you have Raylib installed.

Compile and run:

-> Down Arrow → Move paddle down

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Add sound effects and score display.

Different difficulty levels for the AI.

Multiplayer mode (two human players).

## 📚 About
This was my first try at game development with C++ OOP and AI detection.
The project helped me learn about handling graphics, input, and game loops in a structured way.

ENJOY THE GAME!
